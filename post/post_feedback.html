            <p>Dear Aris,</p>

                <p>Welcome to our program and thank you for submitting the who am I form. I understand that work opportunities in IT could be tempting to choose ICT. What type of programming language do you prefer, since you state you have an interest in it? What in studying abroad interest you the most? It is a big step leaving your country to study somewhere foreign! I hope you will have a great time doing so. You state to become a better version of yourself and make others proud. Anyone in particular to make proud of you which will help you in your study motivation? What do you know so far about IT positions/jobs that might interest you? What field of ICT would you want to work in?</p>
                
                <p>Good to read you like working in teams, that will help you a lot since everything we do is working in teams and projects. Although you might also sometimes encounter students who prefer to work alone. Maybe you can help them with a good team spirit to join more.</p>
                
                <p>What do you mean with dry response? what is it you do? and what do you think is the weakness here for you?</p>
                
                <p>Could your team spirit help out with your threat?</p>
                
                <p>Looking forward to meeting you. Could luck on finishing Highschool!</p>
                
                <p>Kind regards,</p>
                
                <p>Daphne</p>
                <hr>
                <p>The feedback that Daphne gave me got me thinknig about what I want to do from now on, but I think I will find out more about that in the next four years that I will be studying here.</p>
