                    <h2>My Motivation</h2>
                    <p>My main motivation for studying ICT is that I was interested in programming before coming to the Netherlands, and I thought that I could get a better understandig of it by comming here to study. </p>

                    <h2>Why HZ?</h2>
                    <p>I chose HZ because it focuses on the more practical side of programming instead of the theoretical side, which was the opposite in my home country Romania.</p>
                    <p>Another reason why I chose HZ was because I wanted to see how schooling works in other countries.</p>
